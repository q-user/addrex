# pyenv
#   For a library or package, you might want to ignore these files since the code is
#   intended to run in multiple environments; otherwise, check them in:
.python-version

# pipenv
#   According to pypa/pipenv#598, it is recommended to include Pipfile.lock in version control.
#   However, in some cases (e.g. if pipenv is installed locally per user), it is advisable to ignore it:
#Pipfile.lock

# poetry
#   Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is generally recommended to include poetry.lock in version control.
#   However, if you're using multiple versions of Python or local installations, you might want to exclude it:
#poetry.lock

# pdm
#   Similar to above, PDM uses pdm.lock which is generally recommended to be included in version control.
#   However, in some cases it might be desirable to exclude it:
#pdm.lock
.pdm.toml
.pdm-build/

# PEP 582; used by e.g. github.com/David-OConnor/pyflow and github.com/pdm-project/pdm
